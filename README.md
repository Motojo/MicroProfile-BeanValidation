# MicroProfile - Bean Validation example
This project is built with Gradle.  

[Project Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/features/all) is used to reduce code boilerplate and improve readability, it's possible that your IDE will need a plugin to recognize the autogenerated code like setters and getters.

For a guide of how to use this project you can refer to [this blog post]() on MicroProfile website.



# Bonus
There is a _tasks.gradle_ file that contains several tasks like _start_, _stop_ a [Payara Server](https://www.payara.fish/) instance and to deploy the application to it.
  
Just edit the _settings.gradle_ file with your Payara Directory and admin port

To start or stop the server instance type on your terminal
```
gradlew stop
or
gradlew start
``` 

To build and deploy your application just type on your terminal:
```
